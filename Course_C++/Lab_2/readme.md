1. Create (x, y, z)
- Create new vector with provided coordinates
2. Length
- Сalculates the length of the vector that is now in the work area
3. Add (x, y, z)
- Summarizes the vector that is in the work area with the vector whose coordinates are provided in the arguments of the 
  function
4. Sub (x, y, z)
- Performs a subtraction operation on a vector that is in the work area with a vector whose coordinates are provided in
  the function arguments
5. Angle (x, y, z)
- Сalculates the angle between a vector in the work area and a vector whose coordinates are passed as arguments
6. Print
- Just output the vector
